{"name":"PIBASE","tagline":"relational database of structurally defined protein interfaces","body":"### What is PIBASE?\r\nPIBASE is a comprehensive relational database of all protein structural interfaces extracted from the Protein Data Bank and PISA structure databases. Both chain-chain and domain-domain (SCOP and CATH definitions) interfaces are detected. A series of properties are then computed for each domain, interface, and complex.\r\n\r\nThe last release (v2010) uses protein structures from PDB (Sep 2010) and PISA (Sep 2010), domain definitions and classifications from SCOP (v1.75) and CATH (v3.3.0).\r\n\r\n**NOTE: The PIBASE server was retired in August 2015. The code is maintained here for archiving.**\r\nA mysql dump of the database is available at https://zenodo.org/record/29589\r\n\r\n### Citing PIBASE\r\nIf you use the software, database, or webserver, please cite:  \r\nPIBASE: a comprehensive database of structurally defined protein interfaces.  \r\nDavis FP, Sali A.
