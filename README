NOTE: The PIBASE server was retired in Aug 2015. The code is maintained here for archiving.

o Using PIBASE
--------------
 For most users, the web server should prove adequate search functionality.
 If you are interested in more sophisticated queries, the database contents
 are available as a mysqldump at the website above, and you can design your
 own SQL queries.

 This package contains the software used to build the database. This is useful
 if you want to (1) build your own PIBASE installation, (2) setup a PIBASE
 webserver, or (3) are interested in routines for dealing with protein
 structures and protein-protein interactions.

 The code is mostly in Perl, with some C code for more expensive computations.


o History
---------
 PIBASE was developed at the University of California, San Francisco in the
 laboratory of Andrej Sali (http://salilab.org) and the Janelia Research Campus
 of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (http://janelia.org).
